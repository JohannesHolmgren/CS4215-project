function in Go is called func, otherwise same
var and const same

- while loop is written as:
for [statement] {
    ...
}
- e.g. for instead of while and no parenthesis

- if statements same but without parenthesis


======= Concurrency ========
- Create a new goroutine:
go func()

- Create a channel
c:= make(chan, [type])

- Send on channel
c <- value

- Create a Mutex
mu = sync.Mutex

- Lock a Mutex
mu.Lock()

- Unlock a Mutex
mu.Unlock(  )
